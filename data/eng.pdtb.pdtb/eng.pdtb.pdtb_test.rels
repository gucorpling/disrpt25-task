UAL stock plummeted a further $ 24.875 to $ 198 on volume of more than 2.8 million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading .

But he dropped his earlier $ 300-a-share back-up bid , saying he must first explore bank financing . Even as Citicorp and Chase Manhattan Corp. scrambled to line up bank financing for a revised version of the lapsed labor-management bid , British Airways , a 15 % partner in the buying group , indicated it wants to start from scratch . Its partners are United 's pilots , who were to own 75 % , and UAL management at 10 % . Adding insult to injury , United 's 25,000-member Machinists ' union , which helped scuttle financing for the first bid , yesterday asked UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf and other UAL directors to resign . A similar demand was made by a group that represents some of United 's 26,000 noncontract employees . John Peterpaul , Machinists union general vice president , attacked Mr. Wolf as " greedy and irresponsible " for pursuing the buy-out . Although Mr. Wolf and John Pope , UAL 's chief financial officer , stood to pocket $ 114.3 million for stock and options in the buy-out , UAL executives planned to reinvest only $ 15 million in the new company . The blue-collar machinists , longtime rivals of the white-collar pilots , say the buyout would load the company with debt and weaken its finances . Confusion about the two banks ' hurried efforts to round up financing for a new bid that the UAL board has n't even seen yet helped send UAL stock spiraling downward . And rumors of forced selling by takeover-stock traders triggered a 25-point downdraft in the Dow Jones Industrial Average around 11:15 a.m. EDT yesterday . Yesterday 's selling began after a Japanese news agency reported that Japanese banks , which balked at the first bid , were ready to reject a revised version at around $ 250 a share , or $ 5.65 billion .

wsj_2113	1558-1568	1569-1584	The art collection might have come to rival the Medicis '	had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's aesthetic adventure .	The art collection might have come to rival the  had the Florida  office not got wind of Mr.  aesthetic adventure . In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex Hager , the chief of the thrift-institution bureau in the  office , expressed puzzlement that the S & L could be so profligate when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two preceding quarters . The state gave CenTrust 30 days to sell the Rubens . The  office eventually extended the deadline to six months but broadened its demands , ordering that the " book value of the collection { be } reduced to zero . " In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . The state obliquely noted that unsafe banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the admonition to Mr. Paul : " Govern yourself accordingly . " The state agency was particularly vexed to learn that the Rubens and a half-dozen other paintings listed among the  " furniture and fixtures , " were actually hanging in the  house . Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at  . He explains that he was " merely storing the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special dehumidified environment " required for their safekeeping , until  new building was ready for them . Still , the incident was embarrassing . It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited handsomely from his association with CenTrust . For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S & L , negotiated at a below-market rate . He owns 43 % of  shares . Adding to Mr.  problems , dealers ( some with vested interests ) insist that he , relying rather too heavily on  advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the CenTrust collection . The $ 12 million lavished on the Rubens , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its provenance . David Tunick , the president of David Tunick Inc. , a New York gallery , says scholars question the authenticity of the Rubens . It may have been painted instead by a Rubens associate . " The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , " Mr. Tunick says . " It sounds like with the Rubens he got absolutely taken to the cleaners . " Victor Wiener , the executive director of the Appraisers Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very dearly for the Rubens and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a feat . "  not beyond credibility the Rubens will someday be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen . " Still , predicting is tricky . "  forever dumbfounded by what I see making these high prices . " Jonathan H. Kress , the son of the  former owner , Mrs . Rush Kress , dismisses the price talk as " sour grapes . " Dealers contemptuous of the purchase price , he says , were themselves interested in buying the Rubens but lost out . Mr. Paul , for his part , defends the Rubens price , saying a lot of the experts have never seen the thing itself . " Most of them  even born the last time the painting was displayed publicly , " he says . Art prices are skyrocketing , but a good deal of legerdemain is involved in compiling statistics on sales . Salomon Brothers Inc. , the investment-banking firm , in its annual tally of investment returns , reported that old masters appreciated 51 % in the year ended June 1 , the greatest return of any of 13 assets it tracked . ( Impressionist and modern paintings , not tracked by Salomon , are ranked even higher at 74 % by  . ) Salomon , moreover , gets its data on art appreciation from  , whose prices go up with clients like Mr. Paul in its thrall . The percentages omit from consideration the many paintings that go begging at auction . Art indexes track winners , not losers . But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale . Also , at any of  auctions of old masters , roughly one-third to one-fifth of what is offered  sell at any price .  not that there  any bids , but the bids  meet the minimum " reserve " prices set by the sellers . In January , the Preti painting that now hangs at CenTrust was expected to bring no more than $ 700,000 at auction until Mr. Paul came along with his $ 1.15 million . Mr. Hall of the Colnaghi gallery says $ 1.15 million " would have been an impossible price for anyone to ask for a Preti four years ago . " But from his vantage point , it  that Mr. Paul , a customer of his too , overpaid for the work , " a gargantuan painting by an artist who is not a household word . " ( The painting is 10 feet wide , seven feet high . ) Rather , " It just shows things have changed . " Mr. Paul boasts that he spotted bargains in old masters just before they took an upward turn . " They went up 51 % last year , and  do it again this year , " he declares . " They were a sleeper . Everybody was out buying Monets . "  vice president Diana Levitt says the auction house has been " assisting " Mr. Paul in selling the paintings . And while  chief rivals in the art world , private art dealers , "  be happy to hear it , " she adds , " a number of { the artworks } have already been sold , and at a substantial profit . " Mr. Paul claims to have sold three paintings , at more than a 10 % profit . That  51 % , and the claim  documented . He furthermore denies that he relied too heavily on  or Mr. Wachter . Mr. Paul says he had not one but four advisers and that he never bid impulsively . After all , he had the counsel of " curators from the most reputable museums in the world . " He says he expects to sell the collection -- including the controversial Rubens -- " carefully and prudently , just as it was put together . " But in art-world parlance , Mr.  holdings are " burnt . " That is , he is being compelled to put them on the market too soon , and has already gotten offers that are less than he paid for some of the art works . " After a few years , you can argue there has been natural appreciation , " says Susan Theran , the publisher of  Annual Price Index of Art Auctions . But quick turnover in artwork is " like pawning your jewelry -- you end up with 50 % . People hold out and try to get a bargain . "  defends itself and Mr. Paul in the matter . Mr. Wachter says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked intensely and bought the best pictures available at the moment . " On occasion , he paid a high price , " Mr. Wachter concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to resell them at a profit to collectors . Naomi Bernhard Levinson , a fine-arts appraiser at Bernhard Associates in San Francisco , considers it " definite conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased . "  , she says , is " wearing both hats . " " I  see why there would be a conflict of interest , " says  Ms. Levitt . " Estimates are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be . " Frequently , clients express interest in paintings but  end up bidding , she adds , " so we  know who the potential buyer will be . " Mr. Paul , in selling off his paintings , is seeking at least a 15 % return on the  investment , so as to prove that the venture was sound . Mr. Paul says that he has feelers out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection . Because of the pressure on CenTrust to sell , dealers and collectors have been trying to get the paintings at bargain-basement prices . But so far , Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast . One dealer , Martin Zimet of French & Co. in New York , says he " would have loved to buy " a Jan Davids de Heem painting from the bank . " I tried to steal the picture -- to buy it attractively -- and {  }  do it . They were protecting his interests . " Meanwhile , Mr. Paul and CenTrust executives are getting squeamish about opulence . Mr. Paul has been characterized as " the Great Gatsby or something , " complains Karen E. Brinkman , an executive vice president of CenTrust . The media , she says , have distorted his personal life . Mr. Paul nods in agreement . " I  think I have a life style that is , frankly , so flamboyant , " he says . But at just that moment , he is interrupted in his office by a servant in tuxedo who pours coffee from silver into a cup of china and dabs the brim with linen . Mr. Paul says , yes , the ceiling in his executive suite is gold-leaf inlay . The offices are done in hardwood and oriental rugs , leatherbound books and , of course , a $ 12 million Rubens . But he implores that the splendor be played down . "  say  a gold ceiling . Just say the offices are tastefully appointed , " he says . " Otherwise , the regulators will take it for decadence , and nowadays  got to be pristine .

Cementing such relationships with major clients -- car and appliance makers -- is a means of survival , especially when those key clients are relying on a smaller pool of producers and flirting with plastic and aluminum makers . For example , when Detroit began talking about plastic-bodied cars , the American Iron and Steel Institute began a major lobbying effort to show auto makers how they could use steel more efficiently by simply redesigning how a car door is assembled . But steelmakers must also find new markets . After letting aluminum-makers take the recycling lead , a group of the nation 's largest steelmakers started a recycling institute to promote steel cans to an environmentally conscious nation . Battelle 's Mr. McCall thinks steelmakers should concentrate more on construction . Weirton Steel Corp. , Weirton , W. Va. , for example , is touting to homeowners fashionable steel doors , with leaded glass inserts , as a secure and energy-efficient alternative to wooden or aluminum ones . Other steelmakers envision steel roofs covering suburbia . Still others are looking at overseas markets .	Producers also are trying to differentiate by concentrating on higher-profit output , such as coated and electrogalvanized products , which remain beyond the reach of minimills .	1<2	explicit	expansion.conjunction	conjunction
