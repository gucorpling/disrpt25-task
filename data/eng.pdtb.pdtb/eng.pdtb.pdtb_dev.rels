Composer Marc Marder , a college friend of Mr.  who earns his living playing the double bass in classical music ensembles , has prepared an exciting , eclectic score that tells you what the characters are thinking and feeling far more precisely than intertitles , or even words , would . Much of Mr.  film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets ( though probably no more romanticized than Mr.  notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit ) . Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of " Sidewalk Stories " seem benign . On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs . The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers . ( This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . ) The Artist has his routine . He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to . At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home . His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree . He is his own man . Then , just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in " City Lights , " the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif ( Nicole Alysia ) , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother . This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse . She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life . The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night . To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own  shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building . This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it . Mr.  final purpose  to glamorize the  vagabond existence . He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force . The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there  anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices . The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his " Story of Women . " He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one  captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable . Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy  hypocrisy . While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor . Marie-Louise , a small-time abortionist , was their woman . She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies . She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client . Her remorse was shallow and brief . Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home . As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise ( called Marie Latour in the film ) was not a nice person . But she  deserve to have her head chopped off . There is very little to recommend " Old Gringo , " a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution . Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory . I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .
