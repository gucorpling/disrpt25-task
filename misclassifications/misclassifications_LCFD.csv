So the Secretary identified various provisions in Title IV that govern the terms and conditions of student loans and also govern discharge and cancellation in other circumstances, as your question suggested. And I think the straightforward way to think about how the verbs map onto the Secretary's action is that he waived elements of those provisions that contain eligibility requirements for discharge and cancellation that are inapplicable under this program and then modified the provisions to contain the limitations that he had announced as part and parcel of announcing this loan forgiveness. Now you had suggested that there's no express statement in the HEROES Act to discharge loan principal, and that's true, but the relevant and operative language here is the provision that says the Secretary is empowered to waive or modify any Title IV provision, and so the HEROES Act isn't enumerating any of the various forms of relief that have long been authorized and implemented under this statute. I don't think anything can be read into the fact that there's no express reference to particular forms of relief because Congress was trying to broadly cover the field and ensure that the Secretary had the tools to respond to the national emergency with whatever relief might be necessitated. But, in an opinion we had a few years ago by Justice Scalia, he talked about what the word ""modify"" means, and he said modified in our view connotes moderate change. He said it might be good English to say that the French Revolution modified the status of the French nobility, but only because there's a figure of speech called understatement and a literary device known as sarcasm. We're talking about half a trillion dollars and 43 million Americans. How does that fit under the normal understanding of ""modifying""? So, of course, I recognize that in MCI, Justice Scalia's opinion adopted a narrower understanding of that term, but I don't read that opinion to set forth a universal meaning of ""modify, ""no matter the statutory context. And, here, of course, we have a broader phrase, ""waive or modify."" It's undisputed and the states aren't contesting that the ordinary meaning of ""waive"" means to eliminate an obligation in its entirety. And I think, if you look at that phrase in the context of the statute, that means that ""modify"" has to mean making a change up to the point of wholesale elimination. It would be really strange for Congress to say you can eliminate obligations altogether or tweak them just the littlest bit, but you can't do anything in between. Well, but it's ""waive ""particular regulatory or statutory provisions. That's right. That to me suggests a much more focused use of the word. Well, it's ""waive or modify"" paired with the authority to do that with respect to any Title IV provision.

"Arg1: Cyclone Phailin has winds that have been measured at 200 km / h, as it surges over land will it begin to lose strength? | Arg2: Yes, all tropical cyclones are driven by high heat content waters. Once a storm moves over any appreciably sized piece of land, the moisture source is removed and the storm begins to dissipate. As of the last advisory, T C Phailin has winds of 190 kilometers per hour and has moved inland, headed on a northwest track. That is a Category 3 storm. The forecast is for a continued decline in strength to a tropical storm within 24 hours and a tropical depression within 36 hours. However, there will be very heavy rains and flooding along its path. Yes, it will loose strength steadily as more and more of this swirling system moves from being over ocean to being over land. This occurs for two reasons: As it moves over land, it is cut off from the source of energy driving the storm [which is] the evaporation of water from the warm sea surface; Increased friction - the ocean surface is much, much smoother than the land surface. Tropical cyclones are sustained by a form of energy called latent heat, which is released by moisture evaporated from the ocean that condenses to form rain. As tropical cyclones make landfall, this energy source is cut-off and they rapidly lose strength as they move over land. Yes, the Cyclone is almost certain to lose strength as it surges over land. Cyclones gather their strength through scraping moisture and heat from warm ocean water that it is not the case over land. In the mean time, much stronger friction over land quickly reduces their strength. Yes. All tropical cyclones lose strength once they make landfall. However, they can remain dangerous storms due to very heavy rains and subsequent landslides, and river flooding. Phailin's winds will rapidly weaken as it pushes inland. Once Cyclone Phailin comes on shore it will immediately begin to lose strength. However, and this is important, it still will contain lots of rainfall making flooding an almost certainty.",query,causal,0.15480423

"Arg1: A previous cyclone in 1999 in the Bay of Bengal area of India left 10,000 people dead. Is the Indian government well prepared to deal with this cyclone? | Arg2: I have not followed that aspect of the societal response for the present storm. However, historically, there have been several events that should cause a societal response. Hopefully, we all learn from past mistakes. The history of strong cyclones and death in the region is notable, with at least 5 large cyclone events in the past 35 years with 10,000 and as many as 300,000 people killed, millions left homeless and estimated damages as high as US$ 10 billion. I don't have enough information to answer this question, one way or the other. From all the press reports that I have read, the Indian government appears to have taken the threat of Cyclone Phailin very seriously indeed. The government has been much more pro-active in preparing for this cyclone than in the past. The forecasts of cyclone track and intensity have been fairly accurate. Mandatory mass evacuations have been carried out, which is essential to minimize loss of life in these situations. Unfortunately, extensive property damage is bound to occur even with the best preparation. My knowledge of the responsiveness of the Indian government to this storm is purely from the cyber space. I heard that they orchestrated the largest people evacuation to a natural disaster in Indian history. This shall be applauded given the size and strength of Phailin. I visited the damaged area of the 1999 storm near Bhubaneshwar in the summer of 2012 for an invited symposium and summer school on tropical cyclones [...] sponsored by the Indian government. Given the living standard and residence of people living near the coastal areas in this region, the evacuation is certainly necessary and essential to save lives. I cannot comment directly on how the Indian government was prepared for this cyclone. However, the news reports (BBC etc.) were very encouraging in that the authorities were reportedly making strenuous efforts to evacuate the population from near the coast and areas that are prone to flooding.

"Arg1: When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output. In his observations of pin factories, Smith noticed that one worker alone might make 20 pins in a day, but that a small business of 10 workers (some of whom would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved with pin-making), could make 48,000 pins in a day. How can a group of workers, each specializing in certain tasks, produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves? | Arg2: Smith offered three reasons. First, specialization in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage. (In later chapters, we will develop this idea by discussing comparative advantage.) People have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others. The particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents. Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance. For some goods, geography affects specialization. For example, it is easier to be a wheat farmer in North Dakota than in Florida, but easier to run a tourist hotel in Florida than in North Dakota. If you live in or near a big city, it is easier to attract enough customers to operate a successful dry cleaning business or movie theater than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area. Whatever the reason, if people specialize in the production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which they are good at and some of which they are not. Second, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality. This pattern holds true for many workers, including assembly line laborers who build cars, stylists who cut hair, and doctors who perform heart surgery. In fact, specialized workers often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better. A similar pattern often operates within businesses. In many cases, a business that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “core competency”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products. Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of economies of scale, which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines. For example, if a factory produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average. However, if a factory produces 50,000 cars each year, then it can set up an assembly line with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower.",query,causal,0.12472489

Much of Mr.  film takes a highly romanticized view of life on the streets ( though probably no more romanticized than Mr.  notion of the Tramp as the good-hearted free spirit ) . Filmed in lovely black and white by Bill Dill , the New York streets of "" Sidewalk Stories "" seem benign . On Wall Street men and women walk with great purpose , noticing one another only when they jostle for cabs . The Artist hangs out in Greenwich Village , on a strip of Sixth Avenue populated by jugglers , magicians and other good-natured hustlers . ( This clearly is not real life : no crack dealers , no dead-eyed men selling four-year-old copies of Cosmopolitan , no one curled up in a cardboard box . ) The Artist has his routine . He spends his days sketching passers-by , or trying to . At night he returns to the condemned building he calls home . His life , including his skirmishes with a competing sketch artist , seems carefree . He is his own man . Then , just as the Tramp is given a blind girl to cure in "" City Lights , "" the Artist is put in charge of returning a two-year-old waif ( Nicole Alysia ) , whose father has been murdered by thugs , to her mother . This cute child turns out to be a blessing and a curse . She gives the Artist a sense of purpose , but also alerts him to the serious inadequacy of his vagrant life . The beds at the Bowery Mission seem far drearier when he has to tuck a little girl into one of them at night . To further load the stakes , Mr. Lane dreamed up a highly improbable romance for the Artist , with a young woman who owns her own  shop and who lives in an expensive high-rise apartment building . This story line might resonate more strongly if Mr. Lane had as strong a presence in front of the camera as he does behind it . Mr.  final purpose  to glamorize the  vagabond existence . He has a point he wants to make , and he makes it , with a great deal of force . The movie ends with sound , the sound of street people talking , and there  anything whimsical or enviable in those rough , beaten voices . The French film maker Claude Chabrol has managed another kind of weird achievement with his "" Story of Women . "" He has made a harsh , brilliant picture -- one  captivating -- about a character who , viewed from the most sympathetic angle , would seem disagreeable . Yet this woman , Marie-Louise Giraud , carries historical significance , both as one of the last women to be executed in France and as a symbol of the Vichy  hypocrisy . While Vichy collaborated with the Germans during World War II in the deaths of thousands of Resistance fighters and Jews , its officials needed a diversionary symbolic traitor . Marie-Louise , a small-time abortionist , was their woman . She became an abortionist accidentally , and continued because it enabled her to buy jam , cocoa and other war-rationed goodies . She was untrained and , in one botched job killed a client . Her remorse was shallow and brief . Although she was kind and playful to her children , she was dreadful to her war-damaged husband ; she openly brought her lover into their home . As presented by Mr. Chabrol , and played with thin-lipped intensity by Isabelle Huppert , Marie-Louise ( called Marie Latour in the film ) was not a nice person . But she  deserve to have her head chopped off . There is very little to recommend "" Old Gringo , "" a confused rendering of the Carlos Fuentes novel of the Mexican Revolution . Most of the picture is taken up with endless scenes of many people either fighting or eating and drinking to celebrate victory . I mention the picture only because many bad movies have a bright spot , and this one has Gregory Peck , in a marvelously loose and energetic portrayal of an old man who wants to die the way he wants to die .

"Arg1: Copy of my THES piece follows : | Arg2: On September 7th 1994 , at the annual meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science , I found myself on the same platform as Lewis Wolpert . Our debate - about the relationship between science , and the sociology of science - was extraor indarily heated . The sociology and history of scientific knowledge - ` SSK ' as it has become known - as well as being the subject of the argument can help to explain what was going on . SSK has been going for a quarter of a century . It has shown that the results of scientific experiments are more ambiguous than they are usually taken to be , while theory is more flexible than most people imagine . This means that science can progress on ly within communities that can reach consensus about what counts as plausible . Plausibility is a matter of social context so science is ` a social construct ' . Some scientists feel uncomfortable with this idea though those involved in scientific controver sy nearly always find it reflects their experience . SSK has been ignored by natural scientists for most of its 25 years , but is now coming in for some attention - most positive , some negative and some vicious . This may be because many scientists are less certain of their role than they were just a few ye ars ago . Science can no longer has unquestioned authority . I suspect that attacks on SSK as violent as that of Wolpert - a Fellow of the Royal Society and the Chair of the Council for Public Understanding of Science ( COPUS ) - have something to do with t he new insecurity . One methodological precept of SSK is ` relativism ' . Relativism makes people excited . On the face of it , relativism was the focus of the Loughborough debate . Let me explain it . Every practitioner of SSK agrees that to understand the course of a scienti fic controversy one must adopt the perspective of the scientists involved . These scientists did not know the outcome of their collective work in advance , they were each trying to bring about a certain outcome . Therefore one must not take the outcome of the controversy into account in investigating its course . In other words , one must act as though the outcome of a controversy ( a new fact about the natural world ) , was not a cause of the scientists' beliefs . A brief example from the book I co-wrote with Trevor Pinch , The Golem , shows how relativism works in practice . Nowadays , the Michelson - Morley experiment of 1887 is said to have ` proved ' the special theory of relativity ( 1905 ) by showing that light travels at the same speed in all directions . Knowing this directs our attention away from the following : ( i ) Michelson was never satisfied with the experiment ; ( ii ) until 1924 the experiment was never done according to the protocal set down by Michelson himself ; ( iii ) in 1924 , Miller , one of Michel son's collaborators , repeated the experiment according to the full protocol and discovered a variation in the speed of light of 10 kilometres per second ; ( iv ) in 1925 the American Association for the Advancement of Science awarded Miller its physics prize for the finding ; and ( v ) the experimental problem was still unresolved up to at least the 1950s . Thus , contrary to the way the story is usually told , there was no agreed direct experimental proof of the constancy of the speed of light for more than half a century after the official ` proof ' . That the speed of light is constant is , then , a fact that has to be deliberately forgotten by the sociologist or historian trying to understand why the results of one experiment rather than another was believed at the time . In explaining the sources of belief one must act as though the speed of light itself pla yed no part . This is methodological relativism . Methodological relativism is common ground in SSK but over a twenty year period there has been a continuing debate over more drastic versions . Every view , including radical ontological relativism has been held by someone at some time . There is nothing evil or dangerous about such beliefs because they have no significant practical consequences . Whatever the belief , the practical consequences is methodological : ` in a sociological or historical investigation , act as though the world does not constrain wh at scientists believe about it ' . Aside from this , the relativists beliefs are are a matter of philosophy . These days I am a methodological relativist , but if I were to wake up tomorrow as an uncompromising ontological relativist , I would not want to cha nge one word of the case studies in my books and papers . Though my own views are now moderate this is not the point . When science starts to persecute people for their beliefs rather than their results something has gone wrong . That is why I refuse to respond to Wolpert - like ` accusations ' concerning relativis m . To keep our universities safe for ontological relativists , solipsists , or others who want to experiment with radical philosophies , we must not accept a role in a witch hunt - not even the role of innocent party ( not all my colleagues have seen this ) . Let me turn now to the style of the few violent attacks on SSK exemplified by Wolpert . Science , like any other social institution , relies on trust because not every scientist can check every fact . With trust comes an obligation to truthfulness , for if we were all to lie as readily as we speak the truth then trust would cease to exist and information would no longer be a property of discourse . As Steven Shapin shows , ( A Social History of Truth ) , in the Seventeenth Century the Royal Society came to equate trustworthyness with gentlemanly origins . Boyle's experimental reports were trusted ( as those of his technicians were not ) , because Boyle wa s a gentleman . In England , science and social class became linked and to this day fellows of The Royal Society are expected to act with decorum . There are , then , a well - understood set of norms associated with the proper conduct of scientific debate . This means there are two ways of attacking scientific ` heresies ' . ` The first strategy ' is to attack the content of the theories and findings ` head on ' ; ` the second strategy ' is to conspicuously break the norms of scientific debate , demonstrating that the heresy is not to be treated as proper science ( that which is worthy of a gentlemanly response ) . It may seem bizarre , but what one might call ` cons picuous incompetence ' can , then , have a role in the negotiation of of truth . The most salient recent example of this is Nature's attack on Jacques Benveniste's claims about the homeopathic potency of water ; Nature took a team of unqualified persons and s taged a kind of scientific satire in Benveniste's laboratory . In Loughborough Wolpert said , and I paraphrase , that sociologists had presented no evidence for their views , that sociologists had looked only at fringe science and never at serious science , and that in the writings of sociologists he found nothing but o bscurantism and hostility to science . On any normal interpretation he is wrong on all counts . Why , then did he say these things ? Let us once more take The Golem , which Wolpert read and reviewed . In The Golem he will have read eight case studies of the sort which are used by sociologists and historians to back up their views of the nature of science . These include the studies of experiments to do with special and general relativity , the origins of life ( the Pasteur - Pouchet debate ) , and the solar neutrino problem . In the same source he will have read the following ( from the Preface and Conclusion respectively ) : ` Each case study d escribes a piece of beautiful scientific work . But the beauty is not the gloss of the philosopher's polishing wheel ; it is the glint of rough diamond . ' ` Let us admire them [ scientists ] as craftspersons ; the foremost experts in the ways of the natural wo rld . ' Therefore when speaking at Loughborough Wolpert was aware that historians and sociologists had presented what would normally be counted as evidence for their views , that the case studies included what would normally be counted as outstandingly successful science , and that there is a lot more to SSK than what would normally be counted as hostility to science . Furthermore , these issues had been discussed in earlier interchanges ( in , for example , The Times Literary Supplement ) . As for obscurantism , Nature 's review of The Golem ( written by a life scientist ) , suggested : ` ... the writing is deft , the stories are good , and there is not a boring page . ' I think that Wolpert's choice of style in these debates is a matter of ` the second strategy ' ; he wants to demonstrate that SSK is to be treated as outside the body of what is normally considered to be scientific work . Over 25 years SSK has slowly and painfully developed a methodology and assembled a series of case studies of scientific practice . Like any other social science , SSK cannot work at the speed of the experimental sciences because we have to wait for natura lly occurring instances of our phenomena which are themselves long - term events . Furthermore , the phenomena of the social sciences tend to ` bite back ' and this means that social science is always disputed - it would be an uncomfortable world were it otherwise . As it happens , nearly all those who describe themselves under the label S SK are lovers of science . The approach is to try to establish a new way of looking at the scientific enterprise that values it for its expertise rather than its promise of a resolution to all uncertainty and doubt ; the object is to undo the damage that has been done by oversellin g science . We hope , as we say in the Preface to the paperback edition of The Golem , that `... those who may be put off a scientific career because of its cold , impersonal , automaton - like , precision , may take comfort in the discovery that it has a warm , e veryday , exciting , argumentative aspect , just like the arts or social sciences .

As Steven Shapin shows , ( A Social History of Truth ) , in the Seventeenth Century the Royal Society came to equate trustworthyness with gentlemanly origins . Boyle's experimental reports were trusted ( as those of his technicians were not ) , because Boyle wa s a gentleman . In England , science and social class became linked and to this day fellows of The Royal Society are expected to act with decorum . There are , then , a well - understood set of norms associated with the proper conduct of scientific debate . This means there are two ways of attacking scientific ` heresies ' . ` The first strategy ' is to attack the content of the theories and findings ` head on ' ; ` the second strategy ' is to conspicuously break the norms of scientific debate , demonstrating that the heresy is not to be treated as proper science ( that which is worthy of a gentlemanly response ) . It may seem bizarre , but what one might call ` cons picuous incompetence ' can , then , have a role in the negotiation of of truth . The most salient recent example of this is Nature's attack on Jacques Benveniste's claims about the homeopathic potency of water ; Nature took a team of unqualified persons and s taged a kind of scientific satire in Benveniste's laboratory . In Loughborough Wolpert said , and I paraphrase , that sociologists had presented no evidence for their views , that sociologists had looked only at fringe science and never at serious science , and that in the writings of sociologists he found nothing but o bscurantism and hostility to science . On any normal interpretation he is wrong on all counts . Why , then did he say these things ? Let us once more take The Golem , which Wolpert read and reviewed . In The Golem he will have read eight case studies of the sort which are used by sociologists and historians to back up their views of the nature of science . These include the studies of experiments to do with special and general relativity , the origins of life ( the Pasteur - Pouchet debate ) , and the solar neutrino problem . In the same source he will have read the following ( from the Preface and Conclusion respectively ) : ` Each case study d escribes a piece of beautiful scientific work . But the beauty is not the gloss of the philosopher's polishing wheel ; it is the glint of rough diamond . ' ` Let us admire them [ scientists ] as craftspersons ; the foremost experts in the ways of the natural wo rld . ' Therefore when speaking at Loughborough Wolpert was aware that historians and sociologists had presented what would normally be counted as evidence for their views , that the case studies included what would normally be counted as outstandingly successful science , and that there is a lot more to SSK than what would normally be counted as hostility to science . Furthermore , these issues had been discussed in earlier interchanges ( in , for example , The Times Literary Supplement ) . As for obscurantism , Nature 's review of The Golem ( written by a life scientist ) , suggested : ` ... the writing is deft , the stories are good , and there is not a boring page . ' I think that Wolpert's choice of style in these debates is a matter of ` the second strategy ' ; he wants to demonstrate that SSK is to be treated as outside the body of what is normally considered to be scientific work . Over 25 years SSK has slowly and painfully developed a methodology and assembled a series of case studies of scientific practice . Like any other social science , SSK cannot work at the speed of the experimental sciences because we have to wait for natura lly occurring instances of our phenomena which are themselves long - term events . Furthermore , the phenomena of the social sciences tend to ` bite back ' and this means that social science is always disputed - it would be an uncomfortable world were it otherwise . As it happens , nearly all those who describe themselves under the label S SK are lovers of science . The approach is to try to establish a new way of looking at the scientific enterprise that values it for its expertise rather than its promise of a resolution to all uncertainty and doubt ; the object is to undo the damage that has been done by oversellin g science . We hope , as we say in the Preface to the paperback edition of The Golem , that `... those who may be put off a scientific career because of its cold , impersonal , automaton - like , precision , may take comfort in the discovery that it has a warm , e veryday , exciting , argumentative aspect , just like the arts or social sciences .

"Arg1: sandığınızdan çok daha iyi performansı var | Arg2: ve hayal edebileceğimizden çok daha önemli . Halihazırda bildiklerimizi tekrar hatırlatayım . Hem büyüyen , hem de yaşlanan bir nüfusumuz var ; bugün yedi milyar ruha sahibiz , bu yüzyılın sonuna kadar on milyara doğru gidecek ; doğal kaynakları yenilenebileceğinden daha hızlı şekilde tüketiyoruz ve de iklimsel degişikliklerin esas sorumlusu olan gaz emisyonları artmaya devam etmekte . Bunlar belli ki çevresel ve sosyal sorunlar , ama hepsi bununla kalmıyor . Bunlar ekonomik sorunlar ve bu da bu sorunları risk ve kazanç ile ilgili hâle getiriyor . Gerçekten de karmaşık ve uzak görünebilirler , ki bu da şunu yapmamızı cazip kılabilir : Kafamızı kuma gömüp , bunun hakkında düşünmemek . Yapabilirseniz , buna karşı koyun . Bunu evde denemeyin . ( Gülüşmeler ) Ama bu beni bugünkü yatırım kurallarının yarınki amaca uygun olup olmadığı konusunda meraklandırıyor . Biliyoruz ki yatırımcılar bir şirkete bakıp yatırıma uygun olup olmadığına karar verirken finansal verilere bakıyorlar ; satışların büyümesi , nakit akışı , pazar payı değerleme gibi metrikler - bilirsiniz , gerçekten seksi şeyler . Ve tabii ki bunların tümü gerekli , ama yeterli değiller . Yatırımcılar ÇSY diye adlandırdığımız üç faktörün performans metriklerine de bakmalılar : Çevre , sosyal ve yönetim . Çevre ; enerji tüketimini , su bulunabilirliğini , atık ve kirliliği içeriyor , yani kaynakların etkin kullanımını sağlamakla ilgili . Toplum ; insan sermayesini , çalışan katılımı ve yenilik yapma kapasitesi gibi şeyleri ve aynı zamanda tedarik zinciri yönetimi , işçi hakları ve insan haklarını içeriyor . Yönetim ise şirketlerin yönetim kurulları ve yatırımcıları tarafından gözetimde olmasıyla ilgili . İşte , size bunların cazip şeyler olduğunu söylemiştim . Ama ÇSY sürdürülebilirliğin ölçüsüdür ve sürdürülebilir yatırım ÇSY faktörlerini finansal faktörlerle birlikte yatırım sürecine dahil eder . Bu , insanlara ve gezegene olan zararın minimize edilerek gelecekteki riskin sınırlanması anlamına gelir ve de üretken ve sürdürülebilir sonuçlar elde eden kullanıcılara sermaye sağlanması anlamına gelir . Yani eğer sürdürülebilirlik bugün finansal olarak önemli ise ve tüm belirtiler gelecekte daha önemli olacağını gösteriyorsa , özel sektör bu konuya dikkat ediyor mu ? Evet , gerçekten güzel olan şey çoğu genel müdürün dikkat etmesi . Sürdürülebilirliği sadece önemli olarak değil , şirketin başarısı için de kritik olarak görmeye başladılar . Dünyadaki genel müdürlerin yaklaşık yüzde 80'i sürdürülebilirliği inovasyonda artış ve endüstrilerinde rekabet avantajına erişmenin kaynağı olarak görüyor . Ancak yüzde 93'ü ÇSY'yi gelecek olarak veya şirketlerinin geleceği için önemli olarak görüyor . Gördüğünüz gibi genel müdürlerin bakışı belli . Sürdürülebilirlikte inanılmaz bir fırsat bulunur . O zaman şirketler görünür iş sonuçları almak üzere ÇSY'yi gerçekte nasıl kullanıyorlar ? Bir örnek bizim için çok değerli . 2012'de State Street 54 uygulamayı bulut ortama taşıdı ve 85 tanesini de emekliye ayırdık . İşletim sistemi ortamlarını sanal hâle getirdik ve birçok otomasyon projesini tamamladık . İşte bu inisiyatifler daha mobil bir iş ortamı yaratıyor , gayrimenkul ayak izini azaltıyor , işletme maliyetlerinde yıllık olarak 23 milyon dolar tasarruf sağlıyor ve 100.00 metrik ton karbon emisyonunu önlüyor . Bu , 21.000 aracı trafikten çıkarmaya eşdeğer . Çok harika , değil mi ? Diğer bir örnek de Pentair . Pentair , bir ABD sanayi holdingi ve yaklaşık on yıl önce ana elektrikli alet işlerini sattılar ve bu kazançlarını su işine yatırdılar . Bu çok büyük bir bahis . Neden bunu yaptılar ? Evet , ev tamiri meraklılarından özür diliyorum ama su işinde elektrkli aletlerden daha fazla büyüme var ve bu şirket ""yeni Yeni Dünya"" adını verdikleri şeyi başarmak istiyorlardı . Bu , dört milyar orta sınıf insanın yiyecek , enerji ve su talep etmesi demek . Şimdi kendi kendinize soruyor olabilirsiniz , bunlar sadece uç vakalar mı ? Yani gerçekten mi öyle ? Sürdürülebilirliği dikkate alan şirketler finansal olarak gerçekten iyi durumdalar mı ? Sizi hayret ettirecek cevap , evettir . Veriler , daha iyi ÇSY performansı olan hisse senetlerinin en az diğerleri kadar başarılı olduğunu gösteriyor . Mavide , MSCI World'ü görüyoruz . Bu , dünyadaki gelişmiş pazarlardaki büyük şirketlerin indeksi . Ve altın rengi olarak , ÇSY performansı en iyi olarak değerlendirilmiş şirketlerin bir alt kümesini görüyoruz . Üç yıldan fazla sürede , hiçbir performans farkı yok . O zaman bu tamam , değil mi ? Daha fazlasını istiyoruz . Daha fazlasını istiyorum . Bazı durumlarda , ÇSY daha iyi bir performans gösterebilir . Mavide , dünyadaki en büyük 500 şirketin performansını görüyoruz ve altın rengi olarak iklim değişikliği stratejisi ve risk yönetiminde en iyi uygulamalara sahip şirketlerin alt kümesini görüyoruz . Yaklaşık sekiz sene boyunca , yaklaşık üçte iki oranda daha fazla performans gösterdiler . Evet bu korelasyon . Sebep sonuç değil . Ancak bu , çevresel liderliğin iyi kazançla bağdaştığını gösteriyor . O zaman eğer kazanç aynı ya da daha iyi olursa ve gezegen bundan fayda görürse , bunun norm olması gerekmez mi ? Yatırımcılar , özellikle kurumsal yatırımcılar bununla ilgili mi ? Evet , bazıları öyle ve birkaçı da öncü konumda . Hesta . Hesta , Avustralya'da sağlık ve toplum hizmetleri çalışanları için bir emeklilik fonu , 22 milyar ( dolar ) varlığı var . ÇSY'nin risk ve kazançları etkileme potansiyeli olduğuna inanıyorlar . Bu yüzden bunu yatırım sürecine dahil etmek onların vazifelerinin temeli , fon üyelerinin en çok yararı olacak şekilde davranmak onların vazifelerinin temeli . Avustralyalıları sevmek lazım , değil mi ? CalPERS , diğer bir örnek . CalPERS , Kaliforniya'da kamu çalışanları için bir emeklilik fonu ve 244 milyar ( dolar ) varlığı var , ABD'de ikinci en büyük ve dünyada altıncı en büyükler . Şimdi , tüm fona sistematik olarak entegre edilmiş ÇSY ile yüzde yüz sürdürülebilir yatırıma doğru gidiyorlar . Neden ? Daha fazla uzun dönem kazanç için bunun kritik olduğuna inanıyorlar , nokta . Kendi sözleriyle , "" Uzun dönemli değer yaratımı üç çeşit sermayenin verimli yönetimini gerektirir : Finansal , insan ve fiziksel . Bu yüzden ÇSY ile ilgiliyiz ."" İşimin bir parçası olarak , birçok yatırımcı ile konuşuyorum ve hepsi durumu bu şekilde görmüyorlar . Sık sık şunu duyarım , "" Kazancı maksimize etmek zorundayız , bu yüzden bunu burada yapamayız ."" , veya "" Portfolyomuzu politika beyanı yapmak için kullanmak istemiyoruz ."" Beni gerçekten kızdıranı ise şu , "" Eğer bununla ilgili birşeyler yapmak istiyorsan , sadece para kazan ve kârı hayır kurumlarına ver ."" Hep şüphe , hep şüphe . Yani burada birşey açıklamama izin verin . Şirketler ve yatırımcılar gezegenin kaderinden tek başlarına sorumlu değillerdir . Sonsuz sosyal sorumlulukları yoktur ve mantıklı yatırım ile finans teorisi sürdürülebilirlikten aşağı değildir . Birbiriyle uyumludurlar . O yüzden burada birinden ödün vermekten bahsetmiyorum . Ancak kurumsal yatırımcılar sürdürülebilirlikte x faktörüdür . Neden anahtarı ellerinde tutarlar ? Cevabı oldukça basit , paraları vardır . ( Gülüşmeler ) Hem de çok . Yani , gerçekten çok fazla . Dünya hisse senedi pazarı 55 trilyon dolar değerindedir . Dünya bono pazarı ise 78 trilyondur . İkisi beraber 133 trilyondur . Bu , ABD'nin GSMH'sının sekiz buçuk katı . Bu , dünyanın en büyük ekonomisidir . Bu , gerçekten de ciddi bir güç . Böylece bu acil sorunlardan bazılarını tekrar ele alabiliriz , temiz su , temiz hava , 10 milyar ağzı beslemek gibi , eğer kurumsal yatırımcılar ÇSY'yi yatırımlarına entegre ederlerse . Bu gücü bu sorunları çözmek için en fazla çalışan veya en azından bunları kötüleştirmeyen şirketlere daha fazla sermaye aktarmak için kullansalar ne olurdu ? Peki ya çalışıp , biriktirip , yatırım yapsak ve emekli olduğumuzda dünyanın şimdikinden daha stresli ve daha az güvenli olduğunu görsek ? Peki ya yeteri kadar temiz hava ve temiz su olmazsa ? Adil bir soru da şu olur , peki ya bütün bu sürdürülebilirlik riskiyle ilgili şeyler abartılmışsa , büyütülmüşse , acil değilse , dürüst tüketiciler veya hayat tarzı seçimi için olan bir şeyse ? O zaman , Başkan John F . Kennedy bunun hakkında çok uygun bir şey söyledi : "" Bir hareket planının riskleri ve maliyetleri vardır , ancak zahmetsiz eylemsizliğin uzun dönemli riskleri ve maliyetlerinden çok daha azdır ."" Bunda değerleme riski olacağını kabul ediyorum , ancak bu kabul edilmiş bilimsel mutabakata dayalı olduğu için tamamen yanlış olmaması ihtimali evimizin yanması veya araba kazası geçirmemiz ihtimalinden daha fazla . Peki , Boston'da yaşıyorsanız belki de değil . ( Gülüşmeler ) Benim söylemek istediğim , birşey olursa diye kendimizi finansal olarak korumak için sigorta satın alıyoruz , değil mi ? İşte sürdürülebilir olarak yatırım yapınca da iki şey yapıyoruz . Gezegenimize ve ekonomimize olan riski azaltarak sigorta yaratıyoruz ve aynı zamanda da kısa vadede performanstan fedakârlık etmiyoruz . [ Karikatürdeki adam : "" Peki ya bu koca bir yalansa ve hiçbir şey için daha iyi bir dünya yaratıyorsak ? "" ] İyi , sevdiniz . Ben de seviyorum . ( Gülüşmeler ) Seviyorum , çünkü iklim değişikliği mevzusunun iki yönüyle de dalga geçiyor . İddiaya girerim , hangi tarafta olduğumu tahmin edemezsiniz . Ancak bununla ilgili gerçekten sevdiğim şey , bana Mark Twain'in söylediği birşeyi hatırlatıyor olması , "" Gelecek için planla , çünkü orası hayatının geri kalanını geçireceğin yerdir .

"Arg1: Ama ÇSY sürdürülebilirliğin ölçüsüdür ve sürdürülebilir yatırım ÇSY faktörlerini finansal faktörlerle birlikte yatırım sürecine dahil eder . Bu , insanlara ve gezegene olan zararın minimize edilerek gelecekteki riskin sınırlanması anlamına gelir ve de üretken ve sürdürülebilir sonuçlar elde eden kullanıcılara sermaye sağlanması anlamına gelir . Yani eğer sürdürülebilirlik bugün finansal olarak önemli ise ve tüm belirtiler gelecekte daha önemli olacağını gösteriyorsa , özel sektör bu konuya dikkat ediyor mu ? Evet , gerçekten güzel olan şey çoğu genel müdürün dikkat etmesi . Sürdürülebilirliği sadece önemli olarak değil , şirketin başarısı için de kritik olarak görmeye başladılar . Dünyadaki genel müdürlerin yaklaşık yüzde 80'i sürdürülebilirliği inovasyonda artış ve endüstrilerinde rekabet avantajına erişmenin kaynağı olarak görüyor . Ancak yüzde 93'ü ÇSY'yi gelecek olarak veya şirketlerinin geleceği için önemli olarak görüyor . Gördüğünüz gibi genel müdürlerin bakışı belli . Sürdürülebilirlikte inanılmaz bir fırsat bulunur . O zaman şirketler görünür iş sonuçları almak üzere ÇSY'yi gerçekte nasıl kullanıyorlar ? Bir örnek bizim için çok değerli . 2012'de State Street 54 uygulamayı bulut ortama taşıdı ve 85 tanesini de emekliye ayırdık . İşletim sistemi ortamlarını sanal hâle getirdik ve birçok otomasyon projesini tamamladık . İşte bu inisiyatifler daha mobil bir iş ortamı yaratıyor , gayrimenkul ayak izini azaltıyor , işletme maliyetlerinde yıllık olarak 23 milyon dolar tasarruf sağlıyor ve 100.00 metrik ton karbon emisyonunu önlüyor . Bu , 21.000 aracı trafikten çıkarmaya eşdeğer . Çok harika , değil mi ? Diğer bir örnek de Pentair . Pentair , bir ABD sanayi holdingi ve yaklaşık on yıl önce ana elektrikli alet işlerini sattılar ve bu kazançlarını su işine yatırdılar . Bu çok büyük bir bahis . Neden bunu yaptılar ? Evet , ev tamiri meraklılarından özür diliyorum ama su işinde elektrkli aletlerden daha fazla büyüme var ve bu şirket ""yeni Yeni Dünya"" adını verdikleri şeyi başarmak istiyorlardı . Bu , dört milyar orta sınıf insanın yiyecek , enerji ve su talep etmesi demek . Şimdi kendi kendinize soruyor olabilirsiniz , bunlar sadece uç vakalar mı ? Yani gerçekten mi öyle ? Sürdürülebilirliği dikkate alan şirketler finansal olarak gerçekten iyi durumdalar mı ? Sizi hayret ettirecek cevap , evettir . Veriler , daha iyi ÇSY performansı olan hisse senetlerinin en az diğerleri kadar başarılı olduğunu gösteriyor . Mavide , MSCI World'ü görüyoruz . Bu , dünyadaki gelişmiş pazarlardaki büyük şirketlerin indeksi . Ve altın rengi olarak , ÇSY performansı en iyi olarak değerlendirilmiş şirketlerin bir alt kümesini görüyoruz . Üç yıldan fazla sürede , hiçbir performans farkı yok . O zaman bu tamam , değil mi ? Daha fazlasını istiyoruz . Daha fazlasını istiyorum . Bazı durumlarda , ÇSY daha iyi bir performans gösterebilir . Mavide , dünyadaki en büyük 500 şirketin performansını görüyoruz ve altın rengi olarak iklim değişikliği stratejisi ve risk yönetiminde en iyi uygulamalara sahip şirketlerin alt kümesini görüyoruz . Yaklaşık sekiz sene boyunca , yaklaşık üçte iki oranda daha fazla performans gösterdiler . Evet bu korelasyon . Sebep sonuç değil . Ancak bu , çevresel liderliğin iyi kazançla bağdaştığını gösteriyor . O zaman eğer kazanç aynı ya da daha iyi olursa ve gezegen bundan fayda görürse , bunun norm olması gerekmez mi ? Yatırımcılar , özellikle kurumsal yatırımcılar bununla ilgili mi ? Evet , bazıları öyle ve birkaçı da öncü konumda . Hesta . Hesta , Avustralya'da sağlık ve toplum hizmetleri çalışanları için bir emeklilik fonu , 22 milyar ( dolar ) varlığı var . ÇSY'nin risk ve kazançları etkileme potansiyeli olduğuna inanıyorlar . Bu yüzden bunu yatırım sürecine dahil etmek onların vazifelerinin temeli , fon üyelerinin en çok yararı olacak şekilde davranmak onların vazifelerinin temeli . Avustralyalıları sevmek lazım , değil mi ? CalPERS , diğer bir örnek . CalPERS , Kaliforniya'da kamu çalışanları için bir emeklilik fonu ve 244 milyar ( dolar ) varlığı var , ABD'de ikinci en büyük ve dünyada altıncı en büyükler . Şimdi , tüm fona sistematik olarak entegre edilmiş ÇSY ile yüzde yüz sürdürülebilir yatırıma doğru gidiyorlar . Neden ? Daha fazla uzun dönem kazanç için bunun kritik olduğuna inanıyorlar , nokta . Kendi sözleriyle , "" Uzun dönemli değer yaratımı üç çeşit sermayenin verimli yönetimini gerektirir : Finansal , insan ve fiziksel . Bu yüzden ÇSY ile ilgiliyiz ."" İşimin bir parçası olarak , birçok yatırımcı ile konuşuyorum ve hepsi durumu bu şekilde görmüyorlar . Sık sık şunu duyarım , "" Kazancı maksimize etmek zorundayız , bu yüzden bunu burada yapamayız ."" , veya "" Portfolyomuzu politika beyanı yapmak için kullanmak istemiyoruz ."" Beni gerçekten kızdıranı ise şu , "" Eğer bununla ilgili birşeyler yapmak istiyorsan , sadece para kazan ve kârı hayır kurumlarına ver ."" Hep şüphe , hep şüphe . Yani burada birşey açıklamama izin verin . Şirketler ve yatırımcılar gezegenin kaderinden tek başlarına sorumlu değillerdir . Sonsuz sosyal sorumlulukları yoktur ve mantıklı yatırım ile finans teorisi sürdürülebilirlikten aşağı değildir . Birbiriyle uyumludurlar . O yüzden burada birinden ödün vermekten bahsetmiyorum . Ancak kurumsal yatırımcılar sürdürülebilirlikte x faktörüdür . Neden anahtarı ellerinde tutarlar ? Cevabı oldukça basit , paraları vardır . ( Gülüşmeler ) Hem de çok . Yani , gerçekten çok fazla . Dünya hisse senedi pazarı 55 trilyon dolar değerindedir . Dünya bono pazarı ise 78 trilyondur . İkisi beraber 133 trilyondur . Bu , ABD'nin GSMH'sının sekiz buçuk katı . Bu , dünyanın en büyük ekonomisidir . Bu , gerçekten de ciddi bir güç . Böylece bu acil sorunlardan bazılarını tekrar ele alabiliriz , temiz su , temiz hava , 10 milyar ağzı beslemek gibi , eğer kurumsal yatırımcılar ÇSY'yi yatırımlarına entegre ederlerse . Bu gücü bu sorunları çözmek için en fazla çalışan veya en azından bunları kötüleştirmeyen şirketlere daha fazla sermaye aktarmak için kullansalar ne olurdu ? Peki ya çalışıp , biriktirip , yatırım yapsak ve emekli olduğumuzda dünyanın şimdikinden daha stresli ve daha az güvenli olduğunu görsek ? Peki ya yeteri kadar temiz hava ve temiz su olmazsa ? Adil bir soru da şu olur , peki ya bütün bu sürdürülebilirlik riskiyle ilgili şeyler abartılmışsa , büyütülmüşse , acil değilse , dürüst tüketiciler veya hayat tarzı seçimi için olan bir şeyse ? O zaman , Başkan John F . Kennedy bunun hakkında çok uygun bir şey söyledi : "" Bir hareket planının riskleri ve maliyetleri vardır , ancak zahmetsiz eylemsizliğin uzun dönemli riskleri ve maliyetlerinden çok daha azdır ."" Bunda değerleme riski olacağını kabul ediyorum , ancak bu kabul edilmiş bilimsel mutabakata dayalı olduğu için tamamen yanlış olmaması ihtimali evimizin yanması veya araba kazası geçirmemiz ihtimalinden daha fazla .
